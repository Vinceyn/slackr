Assurance:
* Following are the things that we did to assure that our backend implementation is fit for purpose:
   
1. Pytests
    - We used our pytests to debug our code and check for anomalies in our implemented functions.
    - We also modified and changes our tests as often is was the tests that were bugged not out code.
    - We considered most of the error cases for all the functions and along with that, we tried to consider as many cases as possible for each function.
    
2. Front-end
    - We also used the frontend to check for some implementations that we could check on.
    - However, due to the frontend being bugged, we couldn't test all of our functions (like stand-up and search).
    
3. API development apps
    - Some of us used postman for some of the functions where we thought we could use it.
    - We used API testing apps as they are very efficient. They save a lot of time in debugging as well as you see the input and output.
    - Even the errors shown can direct you where the problem is and help in debugging.
    
4. User Stories
    - We also updated our user stories and added acceptance criteria and story point to them.
    - The acceptance criteria enabled us to keep in mind that functionality we want should be implemented perfectly and as required.
    - Story points also enabled us to measure an estimate of how much effort it will require us to fully implement a functionality.
    
5. Peer Coding & Debugging
    - Other than using the above tools, we peer coded and debugged so whenever we were testing one function, we were using multiple functions and doing so made sure while one function works, others work as well. 
    - For example - upon debugging message functions we were using most of the channel functions and subsequently, we were able to test and make our channel functions more perfect.
 
6. Coverage & pylint
    - Code coverage was also used for the development of our back-end to some extent while debugging and testing we wanted to be sure that we covered every aspect or functionality of a function.
    - We also used some tools to correct syntactical and stylistic problems in our code. We mostly used extensions on our preferable text editors like pylint or pycodestyle on Visual Studio Code.
   
7. Final Testing
    - Once we had all implemented and debugged all of our functions, we once again tested all of our functions as a whole.
    - We found some minor mistakes in doing so and that too enhanced the quality of our back-end.
    
    
In conclusion, we have implemented multiple ways to ensure that our functions and in whole our back-end works properly. Peer coding was definitely one of the most efficient ways of finding bugs and improving our code. Overall, all the strategies and tools came in handy and we tried to make our back-end as functional and applicable as possible.
