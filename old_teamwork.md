Work Distribution
* We decided to split the functions based on pytests we all did.
* We waited for Eddie to do the auth functions and then we all could get started on our respective functions.
* Meanwhile we devoted week4 for just understanding the iteration2 and how we want to approach it.
* As Eddie won't be available for week6 weekend, we set our deadline for iteration2 to be on the Friday of week6. Accordingly, we re-adjusted our workload.
* Accordingly we started implementing functions: Eddie did auth, user, and a bunch of testing. Avin and Vincent did channel, search and Kristian implemented Message and stand-up functions.
* While progressing through this iteration, we found out few problems with our pytests and code. We debugged our pytests mostly and accordingly if we found any mistakes in our functions we just perfected them. 
* Our team-members coded in pairs sometimes and since most of the functions are inter-dependent, pair debugging was often done like for channels and messages.


Group Meetings
* 14th October -
    Members Present - Eddie, Kristian, Avin, and Vincent
    We had our first meeting where we decided the following things -
    - Implementation of our Data Structures
    - Organize user stories into separate boards based on implementation (e.g. auth, message...)
    - Modifying our user stories
    - Organize git repo and make branches for each functionality
    - Create an API for storing and retrieving data
    - Begin function development in parallel
    - Keep teamwork file, taskboard up to date

* 17th October -
    Members Present - Eddie, Kristian, Avin, and Vincent
    - We got in more depth of data structures and how to implement it. 
    - Eddie wanted to make a big mega-structure called store so we all discussed how we want the data-structure to be according to our functions.
    - Starting implementing some of the functions.

* 21st October -
    Members Present - Eddie, Kristian, Avin, and Vincent
    - In week6, our iteration 3 was in full swing. We had auth and user working. Other functions were under implementation. 
    - We also discussed about acceptance criteria and story points for our updated stories.
    - Had a little play around with the front-end.
    - Overall, it was kind of a group coding session for all of us.
* 23rd October - 
Members Present - Avin, and Vincent
    - Pair coding for channel functions.
    - Some discussion on the channel's data structure and a lot of coding.

* 25th October - 
    Members Present - Kristian, Avin, and Vincent
    * We decided to wrap up work for iteration2.
    * Eddie tested a bunch of stuff with the front-end.
    * Meanwhile, we all debugged our functions using our pytests collectively.
    * This was the last day we worked on this iteration before wrapping it up.


* We meet quite a few times and as a group we wanted to keep each other informed. In all the meetings we just didn't have discussions, mostly we coded individually or in pairs. Next, we set up tasks for each meeting like what we want to accomplish by the end of a session, this helped in keeping a track of our progress and make sure we are not just wasting time in the name of group meetings.
* However, few things didn't go as planned. We got a bit delayed for channel as both Avin and Vincent have other commitments in week5 and week6. Here, Eddie decided to lend a hand with other things after he completed his work. In the long run, we ended up doing some stuff for others as well. Quite often we helped each other with debugging and technical problems.
* Finding flexible meet-up timings was also difficult as some of us live a bit far from uni while sometimes we have a packed up schedule. Even if someone couldn't come for a meeting, we kept each other informed through git and group chat.
* We made different branches based on functionality of functions, like channel, messages, auth, etc.... Whenever we were coding in the same file we were mostly working on different functions and so we didn't have many struggles with merge conflicts. We just informed each other in which file and function we were working on.
* For our group, it's kind of a chain-linked dependency, we depended on each other to do their respective functions so others can test their functions. We needed to work as a unit to work in harmony.
