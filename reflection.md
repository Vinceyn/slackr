# Reflection of iteration 1

## Creation of the team
We are a team composed of 4 members. We didn't know each other before meeting in the Tut/lab, and we decided to team up in the tutorial of the second week.

## Timing planned
We decided to not focus that much on the project in week 2, for numerous reasons. We wanted to be ahead in other courses to spend the second part of week 3 entirely on the project. 
Avin and Kristian met to talk about the user's stories at the end of week 2 and the start of week 3. The remaining of the iteration (test, assumptions, planning, and reflection) were done from Wednesday to Saturday in week 3.
We planned to finish everything on Saturday evening, to get one "extra" day in case things went wrong.

## Team meeting
We had 3 formal meetings during the week 2 and 3:
* 30/09: Avin and Kristian discussed about User stories.
* 2/10: Whole team meeting up, discussing Task delegation, use of Gitlab and team coordination.
* 4/10: Whole team met up, programmed together and discussed about Assumptions/Planning.

We decided to keep track of the meetings via a "Minutes" folder on gitlab, which contains all of the important information we discussed during the meetings. Theses files have 2 goals:
* Members of the team can keep track of meeting they could not have attended to, especially if the meeting concerned the whole project/an absent member's part.
* When we've got a big meeting about project's coordination and planning, they provide us a useful memo.

We don't need to write a minute file for every meeting of the team. That's why we don't have a minute of the 4/10/2019 meeting, when we were working together and not planning things.

From Wednesday to Saturday of week 3, there were informal meetings every day, where team members coded together. During these informal meetings, we discussed about the assumptions, helped each other, and peer-reviewed codes.

## Work distribution

### Initial distribution
Avin and Kristian did the user's stories at the beginning of week 3.

When we met up during Wednesday of Week 3, we decided to have the following work repartition:
* Avin would do test for search and admin_userpermission.
* Kristian would do the test for the standup_* function.
* Vincent would do the test for channel_* functions and messages_* functions.
* Eddie would do the test for auth_* functions and user_* functions.
* Each member will write their assumption in the "Assumptions.md" file in the master branch.
* The team would meet up on Friday to do the planning and reflection together.

Mid-week we redistributed our work based on how many functions each member would have to test, taking into account that Avin and Kristian already did the user's stories. 

### Changes during the week
We changed the redistribution during the week 3, due to multiple causes.
* Vincent and Avin coded together during the week 3, beginning by pair-programming the search part, then coded channel by exchanging functions and assumptions together.
* We assumed that each function would take the same time to test. This was a wrong assumption, and we experimented with it during the "coding nights". Channel and search functions were time-consuming compared to other functions, and Vincent and Avin took time to create consistent test functions.
* As a team, we decided to be flexible about the work's redistribution instead of following an outdated plan.

Eddie and Kristian have finished their test before Vincent and Avin, so they decided to work in the message functions together. 

About the planning and reflection files, we realized it was not time-efficient to write these files with 4 peoples on it at the same time. Instead, we decided to let Eddie write the planning, and Vincent write the reflection, then to review the files together.

## Communication and tracking tool
We use 3 software tools to communicate throughout the iteration
* Group chat: quick way to communicate, ask questions, tell when we're free to meet up.
* Gitlab: Efficient way to keep track of each other and peer review code.
* Trello: It's a shared task board: efficient way to visualize the progress of each.

The combination of the 3 is really good. The Trello was maybe not that useful because we were having a meeting every day basically, but it will surely help us during the next iterations.
About the gitlab, we opened a merge request before all code's addition to master to get peer-reviewed.

### Potential improvements
Even if we manage to finish the projects on time, it wasn't a great idea to dedicate 3 whole days for the project instead of spreading it more evenly during the 2 weeks. 
For the next iterations, we'll try to work more regularly on the project to have an easier progression, and anticipating potential time problems.
Furthermore, we badly estimated the amount of work of the test because we assumed that test were equally hard, which was false. We had to change our progression plan because of this estimation. Even though we couldn't have anticipated it, we now know the amount of work for each part of the project so we'll assign the tasks more evenly.
