Reflect on your use of agile practices and how you worked as a team.

Your reflection should, at a minimum, include:


How often you met, and why you met that often
What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful
What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3
Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code 


Write this in teamwork.md.
